## How to start


### Create a fork and clone

You want to go to the [My CV v3 - starter](https://github.com/codetapacademy/my-cv-v3-starter) project on GitHub and click the big **Fork** button to create a copy of it on your profile.

The **Fork** button can be found at the top right corner of the page. Once the _fork_ process has created a copy of the project to your profile, use the big **Clone** green button to make a copy to your computer and proceed just like with any other project clone from GitHub.
